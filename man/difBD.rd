\details{
 The method of Breslow-Day (1980) allows for detecting non-uniform differential item functioning without requiring an item response model approach.
 
 The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows correspond to the subjects and columns to the items. In addition, \code{Data} can hold the vector of group membership. 
 If so, \code{group} indicates the column of \code{Data} which corresponds to the group membership, either by specifying its name or by giving the column number.
 Otherwise, \code{group} must be a vector of same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.
 
 Missing values are allowed for item responses (not for group membership) but must be coded as \code{NA} values. They are discarded from sum-score computation.

 The vector of group membership must hold only two different values, either as numeric or character. The focal group is defined by the value of the argument \code{focal.name}. 
 
 Two test statistics are available: the usual Breslow-Day statistic for testing homogeneous association (Aguerri, Galibert, Attorresi and Maranon, 2009)
 and the trend test statistic for assessing some monotonic trend in the odds ratios (Penfield, 2003). The DIF statistic is supplied by the \code{BDstat} argument, with values \code{"BD"} (default) for the usual statistic and \code{"trend"} for the trend test statistic.

 The matching criterion can be either the test score or any other continuous or discrete variable to be passed in the \code{\link{breslowDay}} function. This is specified by the \code{match} argument. By default, it takes the value \code{"score"} and the test score (i.e. raw score) is computed. The second option is to assign to \code{match} a vector of continuous or discrete numeric values, which acts as the matching criterion. Note that for consistency this vector should not belong to the \code{Data} matrix.

 The threshold (or cut-score) for classifying items as DIF is computed as the quantile of the chi-squared distribution with lower-tail probability of one minus \code{alpha}, and the degrees of freedom depend on the DIF statistic. With the usual Breslow-Day statistic (\code{BDstat=="BD"}), it is the number of partial tables taken into account (Aguerri \emph{et al.}, 2009). With the trend test statistic, the degrees
 of freedom are always equal to one (Penfield, 2003).
 
 Item purification can be performed by setting \code{purify} to \code{TRUE}. Purification works as follows: if at least one item was detected as functioning 
 differently at the first step of the process, then the data set of the next step consists in all items that are currently anchor (DIF free) items, plus the 
 tested item (if necessary). The process stops when either two successive applications of the method yield the same classifications of the items (Clauser and Mazor,
 1998), or when \code{nrIter} iterations are run without obtaining two successive identical classifications. In the latter case a warning message is printed. 

Adjustment for multiple comparisons is possible with the argument \code{p.adjust.method}. The latter must be an acronym of one of the available adjustment methods of the \code{\link{p.adjust}} function. According to Kim and Oshima (2013), Holm and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments (set respectively by \code{"Holm"} and \code{"BH"}) perform best for DIF purposes. See \code{\link{p.adjust}} function for further details. Note that item purification is performed on original statistics and p-values; in case of adjustment for multiple comparisons this is performed \emph{after} item purification.

A pre-specified set of anchor items can be provided through the \code{anchor} argument. It must be a vector of either item names (which must match exactly the column names of \code{Data} argument) or integer values (specifying the column numbers for item identification). In case anchor items are provided, they are used to compute the test score (matching criterion), including also the tested item. None of the anchor items are tested for DIF: the output separates anchor items and tested items and DIF results are returned only for the latter. Note also that item purification is not activated when anchor items are provided (even if \code{purify} is set to \code{TRUE}). By default it is \code{NULL} so that no anchor item is specified.

 The output of the \code{difBD}, as displayed by the \code{print.BD} function, can be stored in a text file provided that \code{save.output} is set to \code{TRUE} 
 (the default value \code{FALSE} does not execute the storage). In this case, the name of the text file must be given as a character string into the first component
 of the \code{output} argument (default name is \code{"out"}), and the path for saving the text file can be given through the second component of \code{output}. The
 default value is \code{"default"}, meaning that the file will be saved in the current working directory. Any other path can be specified as a character string: see
 the \bold{Examples} section for an illustration.

 The \code{plot.BD} function displays the DIF statistics in a plot, with each item on the X axis. The type of point and the colour are fixed by the usual \code{pch}
 and \code{col} arguments. Option \code{number} permits to display the item numbers instead. Also, the plot can be stored in a figure file, either in PDF or JPEG
 format. Fixing \code{save.plot} to \code{TRUE} allows this process. The figure is defined through the components of \code{save.options}. The first two components
 perform similarly as those of the \code{output} argument. The third component is the figure format, with allowed values \code{"pdf"} (default) for PDF file and
 \code{"jpeg"} for JPEG file.
