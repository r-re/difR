------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 5.0 (2018-05-08) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The SIBTEST method is now available. It is 
     implemented through the 'sibTest()' and 
     'difSIBTEST()' functions that work similarly to
     other DIF methods. These functions call the
     'SIBTEST()' function from package 'mirt' (Chalmers,
     2012).

  o  Functions 'selectDif()' and 'dichoDif()' were 
     updated accordingly.

  o  All 'dif...()' functions return now an additional
     argument called 'p.value' that directly provides
     the p-values of the selected DIF method. This is
     to simplify the extraction of the results for 
     e.g., simulation studies. Many thanks to Phil
     Chalmers (University fo Georgia, Athens, GA;
     rphilip.chalmers@gmail.com) for suggesting this
     improvement. See other poins below.

  o  For 'difMH()' function, the $p.value output
     argument replaces the former $Pval argument (which
     was returned for exact MH statistic only).

  o  For 'difStd()' function, the $p.value output
     argument is not added since the DIF statistic has
     no known NULL distribution.

  o  The 'difTID()' function has been thoroughly 
     rewritten in order to call the 'deltaPlot()' 
     function from package 'deltaPlotR' instead, as it
     is more complete than the former 'difTID()' 
     function.

  o  Consequently, the 'trItemDiff()' function was
     removed and functions 'selectDif()' and 
     'dichoDif()' were updated.



MINOR UPDATES

  o  DOI numbers were added to the references.

  o  Some typos were fixed.



------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.8 (2018-04-28) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The functions 'mantelHaenszel()', 'breslowDay()',
     'genMantelHaenszel()', 'stdPDIF()', 'difMH()', 
     'difBD()', 'difGMH()', 'difStd()', 'selectDif()',
     'selectGenDif()', 'dichoDif()' and 'genDichoDif()'
     were updated to allow the definition of the 
     matching criterion from an external variable 
     instead of the test score. This is specified 
     through the new 'match' argument.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  Affiliations and email addresses were updated.

  o  Some typos were fixed.




------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.7 (2016-11-22) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The license for 'difR' package was updated to a
     GPL license.

  o  Adjustement for multiple comparisons are now 
     available for all DIF methods, except 'difStd()'
     (standardized-P-DIF) and 'difTID()' (Transformed 
     Item Difficulties). The argument 'p.adjust.method' 
     was added to specify which adjustment to apply 
     (e.g., "BH" for Benjamini-Hochberg). Adjusted 
     p-values are then returned and DIF identification
     is based on these adjusted p-values. Note that 
     methods 'difStd()' and 'difTID()' do not return
     p-values from null statistical distributions and
     can therefore ot be updated for multiple 
     comparisons. Many thanks to Patricia Martinkova
     (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic; 
     martinkova@cs.cas.cz) for suggesting this improvement.

  o  The functions 'selectDif()', 'selectGenDif()',
     'dichoDif()' and 'genDichoDif()' were updated
     accordingly. 

  o  The 'Logistik()' function returns now in addition 
     the matrices 'seM0' and 'seM1' with the standard
     error values of the parameter estimates in 'parM0'
     and 'parM1' matrices (with the same format). 

  o  The 'difLogistic()' function returns now in addition 
     the matrices 'logitSe', wth the standard error values
     of the parameters hold in matrix 'logitPar', as well
     as matrix 'seM0' from the output of 'Logistik()' 
     function. 

  o  The functions 'Logistik()' and 'difLogistic()' have
     a new argument 'all.cov' to specify whether all 
     covariance matrices of model parameters should be 
     returned (as lists), for both nested models and all 
     items. Returned arguments are called 'cov.M0' and
     'cov.M1'. Default is FALSE so these lists are 
     returned as NULL values.
     


MINOR UPDATES

  o  A minor bug was fixed in the 'print.Lord' method. 
     When the 3PL was used with fixed guessing parameter,
     the 'print.Lord' function was reporting p-values 
     computed with 3 degrees of freedom, while in this
     case it should be 2 degrees of freedom. Many thanks
     to Patricia Martinkova (Czech Academy of Sciences,
     Prague, Czech Republic; martinkova@cs.cas.cz) for
     noticing this issue.

  o  A minor bug was fixed in the 'difMH' method. In case
     of item purification with asymptotic (not exact)
     statistics, the DIF detection threshold returned by
     the function was always the one from the chi-square
     distrib ution, even when the 'logOR' statistic was
     used (the computations were however correct).

  o  The CITATION file was updated.

  o  Several typos were fixed.



------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.6 (2015-04-29) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The 'Logistik' function was rewritten. It now allows
     to specify a matching criterion that is not the test
     score (through the 'match' argument). It also permits
     to specify a continuous group membership variable 
     instead of a binary group membership. This is done by
     the 'member.type' argument. Finally, the item 
     responses are directly modeled in the logistic 
     regression, not as a two-way table anymore. This is 
     to fix an issue related to the computation of
     Nagelkerke's R^2 coefficients (which are now returned 
     separately for the two fitted models). Many thanks to
     Bruno Facon (Department of Psychology, Universite 
     Lille-Nord de France, France) for noticing this issue.

  o  Similarly, the 'genLogistik' function was rewritten.
     It now allows to specify a matching criterion that is
     not the test score (through the 'match' argument). 
     Also, the item responses are directly modeled in the  
     logistic regression, not as a two-way table anymore. 
     Nagelkerke's R^2 coefficients are also now returned 
     separately for the two fitted models. 

  o  The 'difLogReg' function was created as a meta-function
     for logistic regression DIF analysis. It encompasses 
     all options from 'difLogistic' and 'difGenLogistic'
     and returns the corresponding output for simplicity of
     use.

  o  The 'difLogistic', 'difGenlogistic', 'selectDif',
     'selectGenDif', 'dichoDif' and 'genDichoDif' functions 
     were updated according to the previous modifications.

  o  The 'difMH', 'difStd', 'difBD', 'difTID', 'difLogistic', 
     'difGMH', 'difGenLogistic', 'difLogReg', 'difLord',
     'difRaju' and 'difGenLord' methods now allow specifying
     a set of anchor items (that are assumed to be DIF-free 
     by the user). The 'anchor' argument was added. If 
     supplied, anchor items are used to compute the test 
     score together with the tested item) and anchor items 
     are not tested for DIF. Item purification is disabled if 
     anchor items are provided.

 o   The functions 'selectDif', 'selectGenDif', 'dichoDif' 
     and 'genDichoDif' have been updated with the 'anchor' 
     argument.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The DESCRIPTION file was updated to meet CRAN policy.

  o  Several typos were fixed.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.5 (2013-04-07) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  In the 'itemPar2PL', 'itemPar3PL' and 'itemPar3PLconst'     
     functions, the extraction of the standard errors and 
     covariances between the item parameters was not 
     performed accurately from the output of the 'ltm' and
     'tpm' functions. Actually, the values were extracted
     from the linear parametrization of the model, not from
     its IRT form. This was corrected by an appropriate  
     application of the Delta method. A note was also added
     in the 'difR/doc' folder with mathematical details and
     notations for the Delta method. Many thanks to Emily
     Price (Department of Educational Research and Evaluation,   
     Ohio University) for noticing this issue, and to Dimitris
     Rizopoulos (Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands) 
     for providing key information to fix this problem.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The authors' affiliations were updated.

  o  Several typos were fixed.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.4 (2013-01-29) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The 'mantelHaenszel' function was updated to avoid a
     technical issue that was occuring in extreme cases. 
     When all items but one are flagged as DIF, and item
     purification process is run, then 'mantelHaenszel' was
     trying to compute 'rowSums' on a vector and not on a 
     one-column matrix, thus leading to an error. This was
     fixed. Many thanks to Yung Chih Ou (Department of 
     Educational Psychology and Counseling, National Taiwan
     Normal University) for noticing this issue.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.3 (2012-06-13) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The computation of the R^2 coefficients in the 
     'Logistik' function was slightly modified to overcome
     a mathematical issue. With large data sets, the null 
     and model deviances are very large and the ratio of    
     exponentials of the deviances might return NaN values
     and affect the output of the 'difLogistic'. Many thanks
     to Marco Pomati (University of Bristol, UK) for 
     noticing this issue.

 o  Several typos were fixed.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.2 (2012-04-01) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The Raju method was improved. Two ways of computing
     the area between the ICC are available: the "unsigned" 
     one and the "signed" one. See Raju (1990) for further
     details. Both the 'RajuZ' and the 'difRaju' have now
     an additional 'signed' logical argument to select
     which type of area to compute. Many thanks to Dylan
     Molenaar (Department of Psychology, University of
     Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for noticing this
     alternative.

  o  Because of the previous update, the functions 'difRaju',
     'plot.Raj', 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' were updated.

  o  The exact Mantel-Haenszel test can now be carried out.
     The argument 'exact' was added to the 'mantelHaenszel'
     function. By default, the asymptotic test (Holland and
     Thayer, 1988) is performed.

  o  Because of the previous update, the functions 'difMH',
     'plot.MH', 'print.MH', 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' were
     updated.                                                                                                                  


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The difR package was updated to compile under versions
     2.14.0 and later of R.
 
  o  Several typos were fixed.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.1 (2011-06-22) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATE

  o  The R code used in 'mantelHaenszel' and 'difMH' 
     functions was modified to overcome a technical issue.
     With some large data sets, the computation of MH DIF
     statistics was impossible due to integer overflow. The
     'mantelHaenszel' function was then returning NA values,
     'difMH' was stopping with an error message because of 
     these NAs. The R code was modified to avoid integer
     overeflow and ensure stable computation of MH DIF
     statistics. Many thanks to Shih-Ying Yao (University
     of California - Berkeley) for noticing this issue and
     helping in solving it.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 4.0 (2011-03-04) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  An important mistake in the R code has been fixed. Under
     the 3PL model, Lord's chi-squared statistics were 
     were wrongly computed (see the 'LordChi2' help file for
     further details). This has now been fixed. Many thanks
     to J. Patrick Meyer (Curry School of Education, 
     University of Virginia) for having discovered this
     mistake.

  o  The non-IRT methods of TID, Mantel-Haenszel, Breslow-
     Day, standardization and generalized Mantel-Haenszel
     can now handle data sets with missing values. They must
     be coded as NA values into the data set. Basically, 
     they are withdrawn from the computation of sum-scores.

  o  The non-IRT methods of logistic regression and
     generalized logistic regression can now handle data sets
     with missing values. They must be coded as NA values
     into the data set. Basically, they are withdrawn from
     the computation of sum-scores and the fitting of
     logistic models.

  o  The IRT methods of Lord, Raju, LRT and generalized Lord
     can now handle data sets with missing values, as both 
     'ltm' and 'lme4' support for missing data. They must
     be coded as NA values into the data set. They are 
     withdrawn from the fitting of the IRT models.

  o  The Transformed Item Difficulties (TID) method, also
     known as Angoff's Delta method, is now available. The
     function 'trItemDiff' computes the perpendicular 
     distances and the 'difTID' function returns the full
     output, similarly to other DIF methods.

  o  An effect size measure has been added for the Lord and 
     Raju methods when the 1PL model is used. It is based 
     on the difference in item difficulties. See the help
     files of the methods 'difLord' and 'difRaju'.

  o  The 'itemPar1PL' has a new argument, called 'discr', to
     fix the common discrimination parameter. By default it
     is equal to 1, and can be changed to any other value.
     Alternatively, fixing it to 'NULL' will lead to the
     estimation of this common parameter (only with the 'ltm'
     package).

  o  The 'difLogistic' and 'difGenLogistic' functions return
     now the fitted parameters of the null model M_0 (see 
     the help file for details on this null model). This is
     to propose other graphical displays of the item curves
     (see below).

  o  The 'plot.Logistic' and 'plot.genLogistic' functions
     have been updated. The new argument 'itemFit' permits
     to select whether the item curves are displayed
     according to the best model (i.e. model M_0 if the item
     is flagged as DIF and model M_1 otherwise) or the null
     model (i.e. M_0).


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The functions 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' have been 
     updated to allow for the TID method.

   o The functions 'itemParEst', 'difLord', 'difRaju',
     'difGenLord', 'selectDif', 'selectGenDif', 'dichoDif'
     and 'genDichoDif' have been updated to incorporate the
     new 'discr' argument of 'itemPar1PL' function.

  o  The former argument 'thr' of 'difStd' method has been
     renamed to 'thrSTD', as there is now an equivalent one
     for the TID method that is called 'thrTID'.

  o  The 'plot.Logistic' and 'plot.Lord' functions have a new
     argument, called 'group.names', to provide the names of
     the reference and focal group for the legend.

  o  The 'plot.genLogistic' and 'plot.GenLord' functions have
     a new argument, called 'ref.name', to provide the name
     of the reference group for the legend.

  o  The help files have been checked, typos have been fixed
     and some descriptions have been rewritten for sake of
     consistency.

  o  The 'print.dichoDif' function has been slightly
     modified: the DIF methods are now printed as a list and
     not one after each other.

  o  A minor bug was fixed in the 'print.dichoDif' function:
     options of the Breslow-Day method were printed even
     when this method was not requested!


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 3.3 (2010-10-21) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  It is now possible to capture and save the output of each
     DIF method directly from the 'dif...' functions. The 
     arguments 'save.output' and 'output' control for saving
     the output (as displayed by the corresponding 'print'
     function) into a text file, whose name and path are
     specified within the 'output' argument.

  o  The functions 'selectDif', 'selectGenDif', 'dichoDif'
     and 'genDichoDif' have been adapted in order to allow
     for saving their output too

  o  Similarly, the plots drawn from the 'plot' functions can
     be captured into either PDF or JPEG format, by using the
     newly added 'save.plot' and 'save.options' arguments.
     They define the name of the figure, the path where it is
     saved, and the format of the figure.

  o  In addition, the 'print' functions display a message to
     specify whether the output was saved (and where the saved
     file is located) or not, and the 'plot' functions display
     a message into the R console to specify whether the plot 
     was not captured, the format is incorrect, or the plot was 
     captured and where it was stored.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  Several help files have been updated to describe the 
     corresponding 'plot' functions.

  o  Several typos have been fixed.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 3.2 (2010-10-04) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The reference 'Magis, Beland, Tuerlinckx, and De Boeck (in
     press)' has been updated as the paper is now published. 

  o  Some typos have been fixed. 


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 3.1 (2010-06-22) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The variance of the log odds-ratio statistic (Philips and
     Holland, 1987) has been added as output of the 'mantelHaenszel'
     function. 

  o  The 'difMH' method has a new input argument called 'MHstat'. It
     specifies which DIF statistic must be considered. Default value
     'MHChisq' sets the chi-square statistic, while 'logOR' imposes
     the log odds-ratio statistic.

  o  The commands 'print.MH', 'plot.MH', 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif'
     have been updated according to the changes in the 'difMH'
     command.

  o  The 'breslowDay' method has a new input argument called 'BDstat'.
     It specifies which DIF statistic must be considered. Default
     value 'BD' sets the Breslow-Day statistic as recommended by 
     Aguerri et al. (2009), while 'trend' imposes the trend test
     statistic as recommended by Penfield (2003).

  o  The commands 'print.BD', 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' have been
     updated according to the changes in the 'difBD' command.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  Some typos have been fixed. 

  o  The reference 'Aguerri et al.' in the 'breslowDay' and 'difBD'
     commands has been updated.


------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 3.0 (2010-04-20) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The Wald statistic can now be used to flag items as DIF with
     both the logistic and the generalized logistic regression
     method. The new argument 'criterion' permits to select between
     'LRT', the usual likelihood-ratio test, and 'Wald' for the
     Wald test. For the latter, an appropriate contrast matrix is
     built up internally.

  o  The command 'subtestLogistic' has been added to identify DIF
     items among a subset of groups of examinees, using the output 
     of the 'difGenLogistic' command and the Wald test. Subtests are
     performed with appropriate contrast matrices built up 
     internally.

  o  The standardized P-DIF statistics can now be computed with
     different weights. The default weights are based on the focal
     group, but other options are weights based on the reference
     group or on both groups together. The newly added argument
     'stdWeight' in the functions 'stdPDIF' and 'difStd'.

  o  A second measure of effect size has been added for the 
     standardization method. It is a Delta measure, similar to 
     that of the Mantel-Haenszel method, and is described in Dorans 
     (1989, p.228, Eqn. 15).


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The DESCRIPTION and CITATION files have been updated. 

  o  The help file references have been updated.

  o  Several typos have been fixed in the help files. 

  o  As a consequence of the first aforementioned major update,
     the first output argument of the 'Logistik' and 'genLogistik'
     functions, previously called 'deviance', have been renamed to
     'stat'.

  o  The functions 'selectDif', 'dichoDif', 'selectGenDif' and
     'genDichoDif' have been updated to incorporate the different
     changes of this version of difR.

  o  The coding of the effect size, which was previously done by
     means of star symbols (*, ** and ***), has been replaced by
     capital letters A, B and C for respectively negligible,
     moderate and large DIF sizes. This is to match the usual
     ETS conventions, and the change was made within the functions
     'difMH', 'difStd', 'difLogistic' and 'difGenLogistic'.

  o  The TODO file has been added as a list of updates or adds-on
     for further versions of difR.

  o  The general 'difR-package' Rd file has been created. It contains
     a summary of the difR package, with a list of the methods
     currently implemented and a list of related references.



------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 2.2 (2010-01-23) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The system files LICENSE and NEWS have been rewritten for an 
     easier display in Rgui. Several non-ASCII characters have also
     been removed.



------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 2.1 (2010-01-13) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The file CITATION has been created and added to the difR package.

  o  The display of the output of Mantel-Haenszel, standardization,
     logistic regression and generalized logistic regression have been
     slightly modified: the codes for the effect sizes are now 
     returned as "Effect size codes" and not "Signif. codes" as in the
     previous version of difR.

  o  Several issues regarding non-ASCII characters in the help files 
     have been fixed.

 

------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 2.0 (2009-12-18) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  The logistic regression method has been improved. In addition to 
     the deviance statistics, the function 'Logistik' also returns the
     fitted parameters of the two nested models which are compared by 
     means of the likelihood-ratio test. Moreover, the argument 'type'
     has been added to test either nonuniform ('type="nudif"'), 
     uniform ('type="udif"') or both DIF effects simultaneously 
     ('type="both"'). The 'difLogistic' function has been updated 
     acordingly, and returns the matrix with the fitted parameters of
     the best model for each item.

  o  The 'plot.Logistic' function has been improved to allow for 
     plotting the logistic curves of any selected item according to
     the best model retained in the 'difLogistic' function.

  o  The 'plot.Lord' function has been improved to allow for plotting
     the item characteristic curves of any selected item, according to
     the model fitted and the returned item parameter estimates by the
     'difLord' function.

  o  The 'plot.GenLord' function has been improved to allow for 
     plotting the item characteristic curves of any selected item, 
     according to the model fitted and the returned item parameter 
     estimates by the 'difGenLord' function.

  o  The generalized logistic regression method is now available. It 
     extends the logistic regression to more than one focal group, by 
     an appropriate extension of the logistic models and the 
     comparison of model parameters. The functions 'genLogistik' and 
     'difGenlogistic' are the corresponding versions of 'Logistik' and
     'difLogistic' for this generalized method. 

  o  Generalized versions of the functions 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' 
     have been developed for comparing the results of the generalized 
     tests that are currently available (generalized Mantel-Haenszel, 
     generalized Lord's chi-square test and generalized logistic 
     regression). These are the 'genSelectDif' and 'genDichoDif' 
     functions. They operate similarly to their "non-generalized" 
     versions.

  o  Some measures of effect size are now available. For 
     Mantel-Haenszel method, the effect size is the estimated common 
     odds ratio, up to a transformation, to get the Delta measure on 
     the ETS delta scale. For the standardization method, the 
     standardized P-DIF statistic is used as the measure of effect 
     size and the classification proposed by Dorans, Schmitt and 
     Bleistein (1992) is adopted. For logistic regression and 
     generalized logistic regression, the effect size is the 
     difference in nagelkerke's R^2 coefficients between the two 
     tested models. Both classification scales of Zumbo and Thomas 
     (1997) and Jodoign and Gierl (2001) are available. These measures
     of effect sizes are displayed by the 'print' functions of the 
     different methods. 
    

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The functions 'selectDif' and 'dichoDif' have been updated to fix
     a minor bug occuring when Lord or Raju method was requested: the
     arguments 'engine', 'irtParam' and 'same.scale' were not passed
     correctly to thes functions.

  o  The examples taking a long time to run have been fixed using the
     'Not run' approach.

  o  A minor bug was fixed in the Examples section of the 
     'mantelhaenszel' function: the definition of the data and group 
     variable were incorrect.

  o  The significance code for standardization method was corrected 
     in the 'difStd' function.

  o  The description of the package (in file DESCRIPTION) has been 
     slightly modified.

  o  The help files of the commands 'breslowDay' and 'difBD' have been
     updated to mention that the currently implemented Breslow-Day 
     statistic is the one given by Aguerri et al. (in press) and NOT 
     the statistic for the test of trend in odds ratio heterogeneity 
    (Penfield, 2003).



------------------------------------
- Changes in difR 1.1 (2009-10-27) -
------------------------------------

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The output of 'itemPar2PL' function was corrected to fix a bug. 
     The parameter estimates of the item difficulties were actually 
     not returned as item difficulties (in the IRT sense) but as 
     additive intercept parameters as described in the help file of 
     the 'ltm' function of the eponymous package. Version 1.1 of 
     difR was corrected to return the correct item difficulty 
     estimates. Note that functions 'itemPar1PL', 'itemPar3PL' and 
     'itemPar3PLconst' were not affected by this bug.

  o  The listing of the authors was corrected in the reference manual
     to fix a printing mistake.

  o  Several R codes in the Example sections have been preceded by the
     '#' symbol, so that they are not executed when copy-pasting the 
     full R code from these sections. However, the R code itself 
     remains functioning but it was not executed during the building 
     of the difR package version 1.1. Anyone interested in seeing how
     the command works has just to copy-paste the R code without the 
     '#' symbol. This is mentioned in the help files by the 
     '(remove #)' message.
